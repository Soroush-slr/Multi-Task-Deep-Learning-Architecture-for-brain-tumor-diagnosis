## Brain tumor segmentation and classification on MRI images using a Combined Feature


🧠🔍 Understanding brain tumors is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment! Our latest research highlights the importance of early detection in improving treatment outcomes. Brain tumors result from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells, and their symptoms can vary based on size, location, and type. Utilizing MRI and CT scans, we focus on computer-aided diagnosis, which includes tumor identification, segmentation, and classification. Image segmentation is a key challenge in this process, as it helps separate healthy tissue from unhealthy tissue, aiding in abnormality detection and surgical planning. With the power of deep learning algorithms, we can achieve more accurate segmentation results, paving the way for better patient outcomes. Together, let’s advance the fight against brain tumors! 💪✨

Our recent study focuses on enhancing automatic segmentation and classification methods for diagnosing medical lesions. We introduced an improved U-Net network that not only accelerates tumor segmentation but also increases diagnostic accuracy. With this innovative approach, expert doctors can more effectively assess tumor grades and design precise treatment plans. By optimizing layer connections and integrating complex feature extraction techniques, we’ve significantly reduced computational load while boosting accuracy.🧠💡
